# Assessing the Impact of Mutations on the structure of Kelch 13
This project was designed to assess the effects of the mutations implicated in the partial resistance of artemisinin. 
These mutations were identified on the struture of the Plasmodium falciparum kelch 13 protein.
Here, you will find the scripts that were custom-designed for the purpose of the project.
